# Workshop2: Deploy a Decentralized Website with IPFS and Pinata

This project demonstrates how to deploy a simple static website on IPFS using Pinata and automate the deployment process with GitHub Actions.

## How It Works

1. The static website (`index.html`) is stored in the `src` folder.
2. A GitHub Actions workflow (`deploy.yml`) automates the following steps:
   - Adds the website files to the IPFS network.
   - Pins the website on Pinata using its API.
3. The website is accessible via an IPFS CID generated by Pinata.

## Prerequisites

- A [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud/) account with API key and secret.
- A GitHub repository with this project structure.

## Setup

### 1. Configure GitHub Secrets
Go to your GitHub repository:
- **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**:
  - Add `PINATA_API_KEY`: Your Pinata API Key.
  - Add `PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY`: Your Pinata Secret API Key.

### 2. Workflow Configuration
The GitHub Actions workflow file is located at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. It automates the deployment of your website to IPFS.
